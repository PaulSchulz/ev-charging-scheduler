** Introduction
*---WORK IN PROGRESS---*

The problem: This software is an attempt to write a controller for scheduling
electric vehicle charging across a large number of charge points which can draw
more power than the underlying power source (circuit) is actually able to
supply.

The proposed solution is to schedule the time that each vehicle is connected,
and connect each vehicle in turn as scheduled.

This problem is similar to the classical "dining philosopher" problem, except
that the chopsticks are shared from a pool that everyone uses.

** Dining Philosopher Problem

Number of diners: 5 (N)

- Uses semaphores to give mutually exclusive access to 'chopstick'.
- Uses a thread for each philosopher.
- Thread loops through each philosophers actions.
- Global lock before checking if available to eat,
  (diner on left and right not eating).
  
Functions:
- test
- take_fork
- put_fork
- philosopher
  - loop for each philosopher
    - wait for mutex
    - test that neighbours are not eating
      - take_fork (and eat)
    - release mutex
    - put_fork
- main

To build:
#+begin_src shell
  make diners
#+end_src

** EV Charging Scheduling Problem
Number of charge points: 4



** Development
Required packages:
- libgtest-dev
